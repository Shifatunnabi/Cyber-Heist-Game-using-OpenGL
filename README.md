# 🕵️ Cyber Heist

**Cyber Heist** is a stealth-based hacking game built with **Python + OpenGL**.

Use stealth, hacking, and strategy to complete missions before time runs out!

## 🎮 Theme & Concept
In **Cyber Heist**, the player acts as a cybercriminal breaking into a futuristic facility. The mission:  
- Infiltrate without being detected  
- Hack terminals to disable systems  
- Collect valuable data  
- Escape safely before the clock runs out  

Failing to avoid detection or running out of time will **trigger alarms** and result in **mission failure**.
